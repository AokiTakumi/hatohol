Standards & Libraries
---------------------
### Using
- STL
  * Containers such as list, vector and map.
  * String (We use UTF-8. So wstring is not used)
- GLib
  * Event loop
  * I/O functions associated with the event loop such as timer, idle, and GIOChannel.
  * Functions for conncurrency such as therad and locks. Actually some of these functions are wrapped by MLPL that is a part of Hatohol.

### Not using
- Boost
- C++11
However, we'll begin to use features of C++11 in near future. Probably it is
when we support CentOS7 (g++4.7) instead of CentOS6 (g++4.4) series.
Of course, we can now use features supported by g++4.4.

Python
