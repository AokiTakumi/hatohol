* Make a file including IP addresses or host names to be set up. Any file name is OK. Here we name it 'hosts' like the following example.

  $ cat hosts
  [targets]
  192.168.10.1

If you set up the machine on itself, the following can be acceptable.

  [targets]
  localhost

* run

  $ ansible-playbook -i hosts setup-hatohol-dev.yaml

* Tips
- When the command fails with the following message.

    Received message too long 1349281121

Create a file: ansible.cfg with the following content in the directory the command runs on

    [ssh_connection]
    scp_if_ssh=True

- When the command fails with the following message.

    Please login as the user "ubuntu" rather than the user "root".

Replace 'user: root' into 'user: ubuntu' in setup-hatohol-dev.yaml.
This problem happens when the target OS is Ubuntu for cloud.
