* Make a file including IP addresses or host names to be set up. Any file name is OK. Here we name it 'hosts' like the following example.

  $ cat hosts
  [targets]
  192.168.10.1

If you set up the machine on itself, the following can be acceptable.

  [targets]
  localhost

* run

  $ ansible-playbook -i hosts setup-hatohol-dev.yaml
