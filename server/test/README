Speed-up technique of the test
------------------------------
(1) HATOHOL_DB_DIR=/dev/shm (path on tmpfs)
The above setting changes the DB path for SQLite3.
It has effect only for DBAgentSQLite3 and the related classes.

(2) HATOHOL_MYSQL_ENGINE_MEMORY=1
The above setting request MySQL to use a heap (memory) storage engine.
It has effect only for DBAgentMySQL and the related classes.
This way is a little slower than the way (3). However, this is easier,
because no other settings are needed.

(3) Put the DB of MySQL on tmpfs
This way is fater than that of (2). However, it affects all
applications using MySQL. So you should use a virtual machine or
environment such as LXC or KVM. Container based ways such as LXC are
recommended because degradation of I/O performance of them is less than that
of fully virtualization ways.

3-1: Edit /etc/mysql/my.cnf like
- datadir = /var/lib/mysql
+ datadir = /dev/shm/mysql

3-2: Probably you need to execute the following command.
$ mysql_install_db

3-3: Install the DB for NDOUtils

If you already ndoutilsB for NDOUtils, you can copy by the mysqldump command.
mysqldump -u root ndoutils > ndoutils.sql (do before 3-1)
mysqldump -u root ndoutils < ndoutils.sql (do after  3-2)

### You can use any combination of the above ways. For example,

$ HATOHOL_DB_DIR=/dev/shm HATOHOL_MYSQL_ENGINE_MEMORY=1 ./run-test.sh

How to show the stack trace on an HatoholException
-------------------------------------------------
Set the environment variable like

$ HATOHOL_EXCEPTION_STACK_TRACE=1 ./run-test.sh

Hint: generate a core file 
--------------------------
If the system uses apport (such as Ubuntu 13.10), some test, which makes a
child process crash, fails. In that case, you should set
/proc/sys/kernel/core_patter to 'core', or purge the apport package.

How to use a specified port for MySQLWorker
-------------------------------------------
Ex.) port 8006
$ TEST_MYSQL_PORT=8006 ./run-test.sh -t /testMySQLWorkerZabbix/
