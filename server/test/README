Speed-up technique of the test
------------------------------
(1) HATOHOL_DB_DIR=/dev/shm (path on tmpfs)
The above setting changes the DB path for SQLite3.
It has effect only for DBAgentSQLite3 and the related classes.

(2) HATOHOL_MYSQL_ENGINE_MEMORY=1
The above setting request MySQL to use a heap (memory) storage engine.
It has effect only for DBAgentMySQL and the related classes.
This way is a little slower than the way (3). However, this is easier,
because no other settings are needed.

(3) Put the DB of MySQL on tmpfs
This way is fater than that of (2). However, it affects all
applications using MySQL. So you should use a virtual machine or
environment such as LXC or KVM. Container based ways such as LXC are
recommended because degradation of I/O performance of them is less than that
of fully virtualization ways.

3-1: Edit /etc/mysql/my.cnf like
- datadir = /var/lib/mysql
+ datadir = /dev/shm/mysql

3-2: Probably you need to execute the following command.
$ mysql_install_db

3-3: Install the DB for NDOUtils

If you already ndoutilsB for NDOUtils, you can copy by the mysqldump command.
mysqldump -u root ndoutils > ndoutils.sql (do before 3-1)
mysqldump -u root ndoutils < ndoutils.sql (do after  3-2)

### You can use any combination of the above ways. For example,

$ HATOHOL_DB_DIR=/dev/shm HATOHOL_MYSQL_ENGINE_MEMORY=1 ./run-test.sh

[Ref.]
In my evironment (Core i7 860 + Mem 12GB + SATA HDD),
they drastically improve the test speed.

1240 sec. ->
1033 sec. (with HATOHOL_DB_DIR=/dev/shm)
 485 sec. (with HATOHOL_MYSQL_ENGINE_MEMORY=1)
 264 sec. (with HATOHOL_DB_DIR=/dev/shm && HATOHOL_MYSQL_ENGINE_MEMORY=1)
  28 sec. (with all the above ways)

How to show the stack trace on an HatoholException
-------------------------------------------------
Set the environment variable like

$ HATOHOL_EXCEPTION_STACK_TRACE=1 ./run-test.sh

Hint: fix an error: accessing to MySQL
--------------------------------------
On some distributions such as Ubuntu 14.04, unregistered users is not allowed
to access MySQL's DBs even its names begins from test_*.
The following command fixes the problem.

    $ mysql -uroot
    mysql> GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO ''@'localhost';
    mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `test\_%`.* TO ''@'localhost';

Hint: fix an error: accessing to ndoutils on MySQL
--------------------------------------------------
The DB for ndoutils is created when NDOUtils package is installed.
However, there're some situations in which the installation of the package is
not prefered. In this case, the following steps can be used to pass the test.

    $ mysql -u root -e "CREATE DATABASE ndoutils;"
    $ mysql -u root ndoutils < ../misc/ndoutils.mysql
    $ mysql -u root -e "GRANT all on ndoutils.* TO ndoutils@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'admin';"

Hint: fix an error: expeted failure code is diffrent on some tests
------------------------------------------------------------------
Some tests for ActionManager fails due to the following reason.

    Failure: testActionManager::test_execCommandActionCrashSoon
    <failureCode == actionLog.failureCode>
    expected: <13>
      actual: <14>

The reason may be due to the content of /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern.
Some distribution (such as Ubuntu 13.10, 14.04) sets it to a command that
calls 'apport' like,

    $ cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
    |/usr/share/apport/apport %p %s %c %P

It can be fixed by setting a normal string such as 'core' or
removing the apport package.

How to use a specified port for MySQLWorker
-------------------------------------------
Ex.) port 8006
$ TEST_MYSQL_PORT=8006 ./run-test.sh -t /testMySQLWorkerZabbix/
