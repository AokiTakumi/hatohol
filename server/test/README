* When you test MySQLWorker of hatohol that is running with port 8006.
$ TEST_MYSQL_PORT=8006 ./run-test.sh -t /testMySQLWorkerZabbix/

* When you want to show the stack trace, set the environment variable like
$ HATOHOL_EXCEPTION_STACK_TRACE=1 ./run-test.sh

* Some database tests may be faster by setting the database dir to RAM Disk as
$ HATOHOL_DB_DIR=/dev/shm HATOHOL_MYSQL_ENGINE_MEMORY=1 ./run-test.sh

*** Hint ***
If the system uses apport (such as Ubuntu 13.10), some test, which makes a
child process crash, fails. In that case, you should set
/proc/sys/kernel/core_patter to 'core', or purge the apport package.
